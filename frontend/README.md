# Readable Project

This is the second project assignment for **Udacity's React Nanodegree.**

It is a simplified reddit clone with main page, categories, posts, comments, voting etc.

It uses all the cool features of React and Redux:
* Routing with router
* Components
* One-way data-binding (unidirectional data flow) from parent to children
* State management through state, props and Redux
* JSX
* Event handlers
* Reducers, Actions, Action Creators, The Store
* Middleware with thunks
* Communication with backend API
* Modals

## TL;DR

To get the app running in development server right away, do the following for from both `/api-server` and `/frontend` directories:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`
* start the development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`

Backend will be running on port `3001` and frontend on port `3000` of `localhost`
